When a dependency service fails, your service must implement strategies to maintain a smooth user experience while handling failures gracefully. Here are key approaches to address this situation:

1. Graceful Degradation
    What: Provide reduced functionality instead of a complete failure.
    How:
        Offer cached or default data if the dependency is unavailable.
        Inform users that some features are temporarily limited.
    Example:
        If a payment gateway fails, allow users to save their cart and complete payment later.
        Show a "last known data" view if a data-fetching service fails.
2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
    What: Prevent overloading a failing dependency by stopping further requests once failures are detected.
    How:
        Implement a circuit breaker library (e.g., Hystrix, Resilience4j).
        Monitor failures and open the circuit after a threshold is reached.
        Automatically close the circuit once the dependency recovers.
    Example:
        If an external API is slow or unresponsive, stop calling it and return a fallback response.
3. Fallback Mechanism
    What: Provide alternative responses or behavior when a dependency fails.
    How:
        Use predefined default responses.
        Use a secondary backup service or data source.
        Allow users to retry certain operations.
    Example:
        If a weather API fails, display a message like "Weather data is unavailable right now. Please try again later."
4. Caching
    What: Serve cached data during dependency downtime to reduce impact.
    How:
        Implement an in-memory cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
        Cache responses from dependencies with appropriate TTL (time-to-live).
    Example:
    If a product catalog API fails, display a cached version of the product list.
5. Retry Mechanism
    What: Retry requests to the dependency service in case of temporary failures.
    How:
        Use exponential backoff with a jitter to prevent overloading.
        Implement retry policies for transient errors.
    Example:
        Retry a payment confirmation API call a few times before reporting failure to the user.
6. Timeouts
    What: Set a time limit for dependency responses to avoid indefinite waiting.
    How:
    Configure timeouts for each API call to dependencies.
    Define reasonable timeout values based on SLA requirements.
    Example:
    If a dependency API takes more than 3 seconds, terminate the call and handle the failure.
7. Rate Limiting
    What: Limit the rate of requests to dependencies to prevent overloading them during recovery.
    How:
    Apply rate limits to specific endpoints or users.
    Use tokens, buckets, or queue-based systems to manage request flow.
    Example:
    Reduce the number of requests to a dependency API to ensure better recovery.
8. Asynchronous Processing
    What: Queue requests for processing later instead of failing immediately.
    How:
        Use message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to hold requests.
        Process queued requests when the dependency is available.
    Example:
        If a user-upload service fails, store the file in a queue and process it once the dependency recovers.
9. User Notifications
    What: Keep users informed about the issue and recovery timeline.
    How:
        Display friendly error messages or banners.
        Provide alternative actions or workarounds.
    Example:
    "Some features are temporarily unavailable. We’re working to fix this. Thank you for your patience."
10. Monitoring and Alerts
    What: Actively monitor the dependency’s health to detect failures early.
    How:
    Set up health checks for dependency services.
    Create alerts for slow responses, timeouts, or high error rates.
    Example:
    Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to detect issues.
11. Service Independence
    What: Design your system to minimize tight coupling with dependencies.
    How:
        Use bulkheads to isolate dependency failures from affecting the entire system.
        Decouple critical features from non-critical dependency services.
    Example:
        If a logging service fails, ensure it doesn’t block the primary business logic.
12. Fail-Fast Mechanism
    What: Immediately respond with an error or fallback when the dependency is known to be down.
    How:
    Use dependency health checks to quickly detect unavailability.
    Avoid calling a failing service unnecessarily.
    Example:
    If a recommendation engine is offline, skip fetching recommendations and render the page faster.

Summary Workflow
    Detect failure: Use monitoring, circuit breakers, or health checks.
    Respond gracefully: Apply caching, fallbacks, or default responses.
    Recover: Retry with backoff or queue requests for later processing.
    Inform users: Show clear, friendly error messages or updates

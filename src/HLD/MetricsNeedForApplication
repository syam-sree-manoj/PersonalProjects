To monitor the quality of a CRUD service interacting with another API, you should track metrics that cover performance, reliability, availability, and user experience. Here's a breakdown of key metrics to track:

1. Request Metrics
    a. Latency (Response Time)
        What: Time taken to process each request (from receipt to response).
        Why: High latency indicates performance bottlenecks.
        Breakdown:
            P50/P90/P99 latency: Percentiles help understand typical and worst-case delays.
            If your system's P99 latency is 500ms, it means 99% of requests are processed in 500ms or less, while 1% may take longer than that.
        Separate latency metrics for:
            Internal CRUD operations (e.g., database queries).
            External API calls (e.g., dependency service calls).
    b. Throughput
        What: Number of requests processed per second (RPS).
        Why: Helps measure the system's capacity and detect overload scenarios.
        Breakdown:
            Total throughput.
            Per-API throughput (e.g., /create, /read, /update, /delete).
    c. Error Rates
        What: Percentage of failed requests.
        Why: High error rates indicate issues like bugs, dependency failures, or misconfigurations.
        Breakdown:
            4xx errors: Client-side issues (e.g., bad requests, validation errors).
            5xx errors: Server-side issues (e.g., crashes, dependency failures).
            Dependency API failures (track their specific error responses).
2. Dependency Metrics
    a. Dependency Health
        What: Track the status and availability of the external API(s) your service depends on.
        Why: External dependencies impact your service's quality.
        Metrics:
            Dependency response time.
            Dependency error rate.
    b. Retry Counts
        What: Number of retries made to the external API.
        Why: High retries could indicate persistent issues with the dependency.
    c. Timeouts
        What: Number of timed-out calls to external APIs.
        Why: Timeout tracking helps identify slow dependencies.
3. Database Metrics
    a. Query Latency
        What: Time taken to execute database queries.
        Why: Slow queries can degrade performance.
        Track:
        Query execution time.
        Slow queries count (queries exceeding a threshold).
    b. Query Error Rate
        What: Percentage of failed database queries.
        Why: Indicates database connectivity or query issues.
    c. Database Resource Usage
        What: Resource consumption of the database (e.g., CPU, memory, connections).
        Why: Helps monitor database load and capacity.
4. Resource Utilization
    a. Server Health
        What: Resource usage on your service's infrastructure.
        Why: To ensure the system operates within safe limits.
        Metrics:
            CPU and memory usage.
            Disk I/O.
        Network bandwidth.
    b. Autoscaling Events
        What: Number of scaling actions triggered (if using auto-scaling).
        Why: Frequent scaling events may indicate resource misconfiguration.
5. Quality of Service (QoS) Metrics
    a. Availability
        What: Percentage of time the service is operational.
        Why: Key indicator of reliability.
        Metric:
        Availability = (Successful requests / Total requests) * 100.
    b. SLA Compliance
        What: Percentage of requests meeting SLA requirements (e.g., response time thresholds).
        Why: Determines whether the service is meeting business commitments.
6. User Behavior Metrics
    a. Usage Patterns
        What: Insights into how users interact with the APIs.
        Why: Helps identify bottlenecks or high-demand APIs.
        Metrics:
        Most/least used APIs.
        Request volume by time of day.
    b. Success/Failure Ratios by Endpoint
        What: The success rate for each CRUD operation.
        Why: Identifies problem areas in specific endpoints (e.g., frequent failures in update).
7. Operational Metrics
    a. Deployment Impact
        What: Metrics that track system behavior after deployments.
        Why: To detect issues introduced by recent changes.
        Track:
        Latency and error rate spikes post-deployment.
    b. Log Analysis
        What: Collect and analyze logs for anomalies or error patterns.
        Why: Logs are crucial for debugging and understanding runtime behavior.
    c. Incident Metrics
        What: Track incident counts, resolution times, and root cause categories.
        Why: Helps assess operational readiness.
8. Security Metrics
    a. Authentication Failures
        What: Count of failed authentication attempts.
        Why: Tracks potential malicious activity or user issues.
    b. Rate Limiting Violations
        What: Requests blocked due to rate-limiting rules.
        Why: Protects the service from abuse or misuse.
9. Alerting and Dashboards
    Set up alerts:
    On latency thresholds.
    High error rates or timeouts.
    Dependency failures or degraded performance.
    Dashboards:
    Aggregate metrics into visual dashboards for real-time monitoring.
    Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Cloud-native services like AWS CloudWatch.

These metrics collectively ensure the service is running reliably and meeting user expectations while enabling quick detection and resolution of issues. Let me know if you'd like specific examples or visualization setups!

we use observer design pattern when if there is a change in state of observable all the observers needs to be notified or do some process

an observer can have many observables
an observable can have many observers
so M:M relation
each on each side

Create interface observable (containing all methods)
Create interface observer (containing only update method where the logic lies on how to deal with change in state of observable)
